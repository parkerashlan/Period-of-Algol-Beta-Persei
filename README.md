# Measuring the Period of Algol/Beta Persei

I am trying to calculate the period of the variable star Algol or Beta Persei by plotting the light curve of the star by using observations taken by LCO. I use observations taken around the eclipsing period of the star, during the maximum brightness, and during the next eclipsing period then measure the flux during these observations and plot them against time to see if I can extrapolate a light curve from this. Plotting the flux vs. the julian date will give me the period of the star.
